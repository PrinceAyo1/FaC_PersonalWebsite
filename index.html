            <p>
              I'm Isaac Fabelurin. I live in Islington. Happily married to the
              most wonderful woman on earth and blessed with the three most
              wonderful kids in the world. I am British by birth, but was
              fortunate to have been taken to my parents' country while young,
              hence benfiting from the richness of the Yoruba culture

            <h2>The Clergyman</h2>
            <p>
              In my other life, I am a Pastor and a Priest in a Pentecostal
              Church in East London. There I tend to pastoral needs of the
              general congregation but mostly with the young people. This
              exposes me to youth work the covers much of the community.

              (18+) up to GCSEs and Functional Skills Level 2. I also work with

            <p>
              When I am not doing the aforementioned activities, you will find
              me in one choir or another. I love listening to music and singing.
              I am partial to a bit of classical (GF Handel my fav), I love me
              some gospel, some Afro music or good reggae (Bob Marley!).

        <p class="experienceDetails">
          I spent a number of years in Civil Service and trasitioned to teaching

          Why am I applying for a programme with Founders and Coders
        </h2>
        <p class="whyDetails">
          After I stumbled across coding while trying to be more qualified to
          teach Maths, I fell in love with it, especially with Web Development.
          <br />
          Unfortunately, we were not taught the details at the Open University,
          and we were expected to have had this knowledge before applying for
          the course. In comes the Udemy course which I applied for. I tried
          these but it was still too much for me to grasp, yet I know within
          myself that these are concepts I can get, only if I could get the
          guidance. Since the training with FAC, I have now been able to
          understand the concepts, and I am very excited to work in the
          industry. <br />
          I see this avenue as an opening to a dream come true for me, aand an
          opeing to my future.
