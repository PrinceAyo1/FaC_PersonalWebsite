<h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
<p class="about">

<h2 class="experience">Experience</h2>

</p>

<h2 class="why">Why am I applying for a programme with Founders and Coders</h2>
<p class="why">
After I stumbled across coding while trying to be more qualified to teach Maths, I fell in love with it, especially with Web Development. <br />
Unfortunately, we were not taught the details at the Open University, and we were expected to have had this knowledge before applying for the course. In comes the Udemy course which I applied for. I tried these but it was still too much for me to grasp, yet I know within myself that these are concepts I can get, only if I could get the guidance. Since the training with FAC, I have now been able to understand the concepts, and I am very excited to work in the industry. <br />
I see this avenue as an opening to a dream come true for me, aand an opeing to my future.
