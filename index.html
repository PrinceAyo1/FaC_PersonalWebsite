              <p>
                I'm Isaac Fabelurin. I live in Islington. Happily married to the
                most wonderful woman on earth and blessed with the three most
                wonderful kids in the world. I am British by birth, but was
                fortunate to have been taken to my parents' country while young,
                hence benfiting from the richness of my Yoruba heritage. I have
                experience working as a Civil Servant for ten years before
                changing career to become a Maths Lecturer in Colleges. I taught
                there for a while before moving into teaching in local councils.

                In my other life, I am a Pastor and a Priest in a Pentecostal
                Church in East London. There I tend to pastoral needs of the
                general congregation but mostly with the young people. This
                exposes me to youth work the covers much of the community.

                recent foray was studying with the Open University to improve my
                work chances, whihch is where I came across Web Development for
                the first time.

                When I am not doing the aforementioned activities, you will find
                me in one choir or another. I love listening to music and
                singing. I am partial to a bit of classical (GF Handel my fav),
                I love me some gospel, some Afro music or good reggae (Bob
                Marley!).

            Why am I applying for a programme with Founders and Coders
          </h2>
          <p class="whyDetails">
            After I stumbled across coding while trying to be more qualified to
            teach Maths, I fell in love with it, especially with Web
            Development.
            <br />
            Unfortunately, we were not taught the details at the Open
            University, and we were expected to have had this knowledge before
            applying for the course. In comes the Udemy course which I applied
            for. I tried these but it was still too much for me to grasp, yet I
            know within myself that these are concepts I can get, only if I
            could get the guidance. Since the training with FAC, I have now been
            able to understand the concepts, and I am very excited to work in
            the industry. <br />
            <br />
            I see this avenue as an opening to a dream come true for me, aand an
            opeing to my future.
